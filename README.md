The EQuA project is a 4 year RAAK-PRO project. The project has started in the fall of 2010, and so will run until the fall of 2014. EQuA is an acronym for Early Quality Assurance in software production. The project aims at the detection and correction of errors in the process of software production, in a stage as early as possible. Or, stated otherwise: the project aims at achieving a quality standard as high as possible in a stage as early as possible.

Both in the scientific world and in the software development community the quality problem is addressed. The goal of the EQuA project is to bring togheter knowledge and insights from both sides, and from there to create practical solutions.

The EQuA project is a collaboration of eight partners: two universities of applied science, three scientific institutions and three IT companies. Fontys ICT manages the project. See the tab Partners for a complete overview of the participants. 

The goal of a RAAK-PRO project is to stimulate applied research, in co-operation with scientific institutions and IT-companies. These projects are initiated from the Stichting Kennisontwikkeling HBO (SKO). The implementation is in the hands of the Stichting Innovatie Alliantie (SIA). The funding comes from the Ministry of Eduaction, Culture and Science.
